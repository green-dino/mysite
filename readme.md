# Django with PostgreSQL in Docker

This repository provides a template for quickly setting up a Django project with a PostgreSQL database, all running inside Docker containers. This setup is designed for rapid development and deployment of data environments with a useful web interface.

## Features

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open source object-relational database system.
- **Docker**: Simplifies deployment by containerizing the application and its dependencies.
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates multiple Docker containers to work together.
